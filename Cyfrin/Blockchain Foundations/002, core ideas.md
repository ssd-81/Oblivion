## what is blockchain?
- what separates bitcoin and ethereum? 
- bitcoin is intentionally turing incomplete. think deeply about this. 
- blockchains are intentionally walled off from the digital system; this leads us to the oracle problem. 

## oracle problem
- blockchains are deterministic system and deterministic on purpose. 
- an oracle is any device which connects blockchain to off-chain data. 
- also, they are responsible for running external computations. 
- the oracle networks also needs to be decentralized, because we cannot get most of the data from one source; so the oracle network is itself decentralized. 
> on chain data is decentralized , but the off chain data is too because of the decentralized oracles
- `Hybrid smart contracts = Onchain + OffChain aggrements` ; most protocols that we interact with today are in some form or other hybrid smart contracts. 
- what is chainlink?
	- it is a decentralized oracle network.
	- chainlink is blockchain agnostic. wait, why?

> **don't worry about learning any particular chain or anything specific; most ideas are highly tranferrable and can easily be modeled/ changed with very few changes; let the construct sink in deep, don't focus too much on the tools. 


## layer 2s
- these exist to solve the scalability issue of blockchains; most blockchains have problems to scale beyond a point , the most prominent example being Ethereum itself. l2s allow blockchains to solve the scalability. 
- currently, there are two major type of rollups
	- optimistic rollups
	- zero knowledge rollups


## what is the value of smart contracts?
- a pretty good question, actually. 
- simple answer: trust minimized agreements
- simplified further: unbreakable promises
