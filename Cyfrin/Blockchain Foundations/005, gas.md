## gas fundamentals
- Gas is a measure of computation. 
- gas depends on the complexity of transactions. 
- more instructions usually means more gas. 
- we can break down each transactions into evm opcodes and calculate/ verify the gas fees. It is hardcore math. 
- transaction cost = gas price \* gas used
- this gas price is paid to the validators / miner who actually process the transactions, so that it can be on chain. 
- it is actually very difficult to get hands on testnet eth.
