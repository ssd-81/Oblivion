> Asking questions to a human is a skill and a really valuable one. 

- Take breaks; they are really really important; especially while learning something valuable and taxing. Learning hard things isn't about going all in for once and abandoning it ; it is all about sticking to the process. 
- Pace yourself ; no need to compare yourself to anyone; it is all about what is in accord to your system. 
- After every section, it is a good idea to revisit the section and try to question yourself (active recall.)
- **Repetition** is the mother of all skills. 
- The rea skill is not really about knowing a programming language or some tool, but about how and whom to ask about problems that you don't understand; simply collaboration. 
- A technology is just a solution and the solution is as valuable as the problem it is trying to solve.
